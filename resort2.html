    <p>The Maldives is a secret location mostly known to the rich and famous who thrive on the natural mantra sound of the ocean.
       To name a few, Maldives Kaadedhdoo, Gran Maldives and Hanimaadhoo, offer a nice balance that cater for most clients. Some resorts will offer younger clients the celebrity feel more than others, so check the resorts as many will offer better facilities for children, disabled access, functions or events. Western clients should note that The Maldives is under muslin laws, so nudity issues will apply. 
       But like Dubai its expected that beachwear will be used as normal. The natural sea water is among the best in the world, offering 2020 vision in some of the Maldivian bays. This all plays to luxury meditation and spa treatments if you need to relax all out. Most Maldive resorts offer the best range of water-sport and music evening to support the social element.</p>
